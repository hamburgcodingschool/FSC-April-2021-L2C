Stage 3
###### 3.1 Sally wants to help you keep track of your social media consumption

Let's have Sally keep track of the following: the number of minutes that the user has spent online each day, for the last 5 days.

Sally can then compute some statistics for us.

The bot should:

- [ ] hardcode an array of numbers
- [ ] print the array of numbers
- [ ] Print the average time spent on social media (in minutes)
- [ ] Print the maximum time spent in a day (in minutes)
- [ ] Print the minimum time spent in a day (in minutes)
- [ ] Print the total amount of time spent on social media (in minutes)
- [ ] All of the above, but in hours


**Example Output**
```
This is the time you spent on social media in the last 5 days:
[40, 30, 20, 45, 15]

The average time is: 35 minutes.

The maximum time spent in a day is: 45 minutes.

The minimum time spent in a day is: 15 minutes.

The total time spent in the last 5 days is: 150 minutes.

```





##### Arrays Fun

1. Start with a hardcoded array and a hardcoded number. Count the occurences of the hardcoded number in the array;

2. Start with a hardcoded array. 
2.1 Count the even numbers in the array;
2.2 Count the odd numbers in an array;

##### Bonus
3. Start with a hardcoded array. 
3.1 Check if there is a number that appears at least 2 times in the array; 
3.2 Check if there are more numbers that appear at least 2 times in the array;

**Hint** You can also use a for loop inside a for loop :) 

4. Start with a hardcoded array. Rotate the array clockwise by 1

```
// example
[15, 17, 18] -> [18, 15, 17]
```

5. Start with a hardcoded array. Reverse the values in the array without using an additional array.

**Hint** You don't always have to iterate throughout the whole array; Sometimes going halfway through is enough.

6. Start with 2 hardcoded arrays. Find the common elements of the two arrays.

7. Start with a hardcoded array. Find and print all the leaders in the array. A leader is the element which is strictly larger than all of the elements to its right.
